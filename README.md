3-Axis Digital Accelerometer is the key part in projects like orientation detection, gesture detection and Motion detection. This 3-Asix Digital Accelerometer(Â±1.5g) is based on Freescale's low power consumption module, MMA7660FC. It features up to 10,000g high shock surviability and configurable Samples per Second rate. For generous applications that don't require too large measurement range, this is a great choice because it's durable, energy saving and cost-efficient.
